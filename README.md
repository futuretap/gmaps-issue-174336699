# Sample App 

This is derived from the official Google sample app. I just changed the location of the Street View panorama.

- Run `pod install` to install the Google Maps SDK
- Open SwiftExample/GoogleMapsSwiftDemos.xcworkspace
- Edit `SDKConstants.swift` and paste a valid API key
- Run the app and open the "Street View" example
- Open the debugging log and note the printed values of the GMSPanoramaLinks for the displayed panorama
